\section{Introduction}
    RoboIME is a small-size league soccer robot team from IME, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This
is only the 5th time the team is taking part in competitions. The main result was in 2012
when the team achieved second place in Latin American Robotics Competition.

All students that work in this project are members of the Laboratório de Robótica e
Inteligência Computacional at IME. The previous studies \cite{alexandre}\cite{marco} provided
the basis for the current structure of software and hardware team's. This paper describes the
computer, electronic and mechanical designs.

This work is organized as follows. First the mechanical design of RoboIME robots is presented at section \ref{mec_sec}. Then the firmware and electrical project is presented at section \ref{emb_sys_sec}. After, the software system is presented at section \ref{soft_sys_sec}. Finally at section \ref{dic_fut_sec} discussion and future work are described.
