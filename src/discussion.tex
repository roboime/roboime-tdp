\section{Discussion and Future Works}\label{dic_fut_sec}

The development of the mechanical project was concluded last year, based on the
one we created for Brazilian Robotics Competition 2012. The six robots have
already been manufactured, with only a few parts still needing rework.

Some electronic prototypes were made, yet stabilizing efforts are still
ongoing. Problems with kicker board due to hight welding temperature were
observed. The solution was to use a welding temperature below
$260\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$.

The five modules of the AI system have already been implemented but they still
need to be brought to perfection. Research in machine learning was started last
year to predict enemy behaviour, but an implementation is not planned for this
competition.

For the this competition, following goals are being sought: rework the
remaining parts on the mechanical project such as making improvements on the
coiling of the solenoid coil; stabilize the electronic project, including robot
feedback and conclude the implementation of planning algorithms to be used in
support decision making.
