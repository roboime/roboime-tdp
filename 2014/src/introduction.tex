\section{Introduction}
RoboIME is a small-size league soccer robot team from IME, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This
is only the 5th time the team is taking part in competitions. The biggest result achieved was in 2012
when the team achieved second place in Latin American Robotics Competition.

All students that work in this project are members of the Laboratório de Robótica e
Inteligência Computacional at IME. Previous studies \cite{alexandre}\cite{marco} provided
the basis for the current structure of software and hardware teams. This paper describes the
computer, electronic and mechanical designs.

This work is organized as follows. The mechanical design of RoboIME robots is presented in section \ref{mec_sec}. Then the firmware and electrical project is presented in section \ref{emb_sys_sec}. The software system is presented in section \ref{soft_sys_sec}. Finally, discussion and future work are described in section \ref{dic_fut_sec}.
