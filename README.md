RoboIME TDP
===========

This is the latex project used to write our TDP. Feel free to use it as a base for your team.

As per [the qualification page][1] it must comply to the [Springer LNAI format][2].

The latex class used on this project can be found on [this page][3].

LARC/CBR
--------

The LARC (Latin American Robotics Competition) and CBR (Competição Brasileira de Robótica) both
make use of the IEEE conference format.

A file named roboime-tdp-larc.tex is used to keep it separate from the main one.

The latex class is available on [this page][4].
